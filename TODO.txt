todo items & test cases

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Event and Workorder processing

- Global search

- When Site Mgr vets the event, they mark it as preventative maint, or breakdown maint  ???

- On site mgr or admin only ... raise issue modal dialog to have preventative maint option

- Be able to remove any doc
- Full test cases and QA with doc attachments and doc pointers

- On workorder entry, match people to skills

- With event document card list, stack the text under the image
- With workorder document card list, stack the text under the image

- With workorder document updates, refresh data and screen, the same
	way that the event screen works

- Add workorder to event, needs to reload event-workorder data	

- New workorder default start data no longer works ... fix

- Once workorder is created, should lock down the details and not allow edits
	* OR *
	- if add new assignee, add them to the workorder, and generate a Workorder email for them
	- if add new doc, then send the new doc out to existing participants for the existing workorders

- Event search
- WorkOrder search

- Event list, toggle view all / open events
- WorkOrder list, toggle view all / open workorders

- Annotate WorkOrder
- Close off WorkOrder
- Close off Event

- On close workorder, close off event (if no other workorders pending)
- On close event, clear tool (if no other events pending)
- On clear tool, clear machine (if all tools are clear)

- Allow user to edit the description of docs that are attached to the event

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Scheduling Maintenance

- Allow the Site Mgr to very easily create a new Event of type Preventative Maint,
	which can be used to attach workorders to as needed

- Allow the Site Mgr to maintain a Preventative Maint Schedule, with pre-canned 
	workorders, and store these on the basis of :
	- Per tool
	- Per machine
	- Per site

- System shall report on suggested preventative maint that is due, either by
	displaying the suggestions on the dashboard, the daily digest email, or 
	raising a maint event automatically


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Ports

- Port all WorkOrder and Event processing code and changes to Site Manager


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Reporting 

- Email daily digest

- User sub / unsub from daily digest email

- 

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Code Refactors

- All socket comms should be wrapped in channels


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Known bugs

- Some docs still have type "event" in place of "toolevent" 
	(seems to be for docs that are supposed to be attached to a workordeg)

- WorkOrder details not showing the time correctly

- On raise new issue, if you add a photo, and then back of raising the issue,
	this leaves an orphaned doc still temporarily attached to the event

- CSS hover over lists loses any hilighting colors

- Add document to existing workorder ... tries to call /docs/toolevent


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Done Today

- Notes field on w/order entry screen
