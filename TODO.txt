- Add workorder to event, needs to reload event-workorder data	

- New workorder default start data no longer works ... fix

- Once workorder is created, should lock down the details and not allow edits ?
	** Better **

	- if add new doc, then send the new doc out to existing participants for the existing workorders

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Known bugs

- Some docs still have type "event" in place of "toolevent" 
	(seems to be for docs that are supposed to be attached to a workordeg)

- WorkOrder details not showing the time correctly

- On raise new issue, if you add a photo, and then back of raising the issue,
	this leaves an orphaned doc still temporarily attached to the event

- CSS hover over lists loses any hilighting colors

- Add document to existing workorder ... tries to call /docs/toolevent

- new workorder ... WO notes not appearing on WO initial email ??


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Done Today

- Notes field on w/order entry screen
- With event document card list, stack the text under the image
- With workorder document card list, stack the text under the image


- Allow the Site Mgr to very easily create a new Event of type Preventative Maint,
	which can be used to attach workorders to as needed

- On site mgr or admin only ... raise issue modal dialog to have preventative maint option
