todo items & test cases

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Works in Progress





//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Event and Workorder processing

- Global search

- Be able to remove any doc

- User manual

- Full test cases and QA with doc attachments and doc pointers

- On workorder entry, match people to skills

- Update details of a live workorder (start date / duration / descr, etc ....) that is not yet complete,
  then popup another dialog with :
  	- list of participants with checkboxes. Select which one to send an email to
  	- notes field to edit the contents of the update
  	- submit btn to generate the email(s)


- Add estimated costs to workorders, and include this data in reports

- Once workorder is created, should lock down the details and not allow edits ?
	** Better **
	- if add new assignee, add them to the workorder, and generate a Workorder email for them
	- if add new doc, then send the new doc out to existing participants for the existing workorders


- Event search

- WorkOrder search

- Event list, toggle view all / open events

- WorkOrder list, toggle view all / open workorders

- Annotate WorkOrder as it progresses

- Close off WorkOrder
- Close off Event

- On close workorder, close off event (if no other workorders pending)
- On close event, clear tool (if no other events pending)
- On clear tool, clear machine (if all tools on that machine are clear)
- Allow user to edit the description of docs that are attached to the event

- Be able to mark the workorder as acknowledged or accepted ...
	Either manually by the site mgr, or by the tech logging in
	and acknowledging the workorder

- Raise an alarm for workorders that are not acknowledged after a set 
	acceptable delay

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// General Data Management

- Edit parts that make up a tool


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Feature Mapping with FastMaint

- "Task Templates" .. sort of have this with the notes and docs attached to each site / machine / tool


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Scheduling Maintenance


- Allow the Site Mgr to maintain a Preventative Maint Schedule, with pre-canned 
	workorders, and store these on the basis of :
	- Per tool
	- Per machine
	- Per site

- System shall report on suggested preventative maint that is due, either by
	displaying the suggestions on the dashboard, the daily digest email, or 
	raising a maint event automatically


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Ports

- Port all WorkOrder and Event processing code and changes to Site Manager


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Reporting 

- Email daily digest

- User sub / unsub from daily digest email

- Graphs as needed

- Cost reporting, including estimated costs for work in progress, and estimated preventative maint costs
  that are projected forward
  

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Code Refactors

- All socket comms should be wrapped in channels


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Known bugs


- On raise new issue, if you add a photo, and then back off from raising the issue,
	this leaves an orphaned doc still temporarily attached to the event

- CSS hover over lists loses any hilighting colors



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Done 

- Notes field on w/order entry screen
- With event document card list, stack the text under the image
- With workorder document card list, stack the text under the image


- Allow the Site Mgr to very easily create a new Event of type Preventative Maint,
	which can be used to attach workorders to as needed

- On site mgr or admin only ... raise issue modal dialog to have preventative maint option

- Trace updating workorder .... 

- Fill in time on displaying workorder

- New workorder default start date no longer works ... fix

- Add workorder to event, needs to reload event-workorder data	

- With workorder document updates, refresh data and screen, the same
	way that the event screen works

- WorkOrder details not showing the time correctly

- Some docs still have type "event" in place of "toolevent" 
	(seems to be for docs that are supposed to be attached to a workordeg)

- Add document to existing workorder ... tries to call /docs/toolevent

- new workorder ... WO notes not appearing on WO initial email ??
