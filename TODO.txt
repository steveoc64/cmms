- Trace updating workorder .... 

- Fill in time on displaying workorder

- New workorder default start date no longer works ... fix

- Add workorder to event, needs to reload event-workorder data	

- With workorder document updates, refresh data and screen, the same
	way that the event screen works

- WorkOrder details not showing the time correctly

- Some docs still have type "event" in place of "toolevent" 
	(seems to be for docs that are supposed to be attached to a workordeg)
